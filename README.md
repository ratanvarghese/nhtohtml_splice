# nhtohtml_splice
nhtohtml edited for use with SpliceHack

This is based on http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~simra/nhtohtml/

Unfortunately, this is *not* based on https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/User:Qazmlpok/nhtohtml and probably has some bugs not present in Qazmlpok's version.

Unlike the prior versions of nhtohtml, nhtohtml_splice generates a single giant table of monster info. It also supports the MON2, MON3 and MON4 macros.
